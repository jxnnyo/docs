## Structure (Example)

```lua config.lua
{
    {
        icon = "circle-user",
        text = "{callsign} | {name}",
    },
    {
        icon = "locate",
        text = "{street}",
    },
    {
        icon = "circle-user",
        text = "{gender}",
    },
}
```

## Breakdown

- `icon`: We use [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) for our icon library. Documentation for finding the correct value for here can be found [here](https://scribehow.com/shared/Find_and_download_icons_from_Lucide_website__1Ky67RRdT9aC4K_bdef_2w?referrer=docs)
- `text`: This is a string but has extended capabilities, these are 'template strings'. We replace anything that has a string surrounded by {} if we have the data. Current options can be found below.
