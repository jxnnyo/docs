Installing **jx_dispatch** with Qbox/QBCore based servers is a two-step process: install, configure. 

## 1. Installing the resource

Download the resource and put it into your server files along with [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib).

Start order must be like this

```cfg server.cfg
ensure ox_lib
ensure jx_dispatch
```

## 2. Configuring the resource

- Open `resource/config.lua`
- Set the `Config.Framework` value to either `qbox` or `qbcore`
- Change the `Config.DefaultKey`, a list of available options are [here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/input-mapper-parameter-ids/keyboard/)
- Add all of your police jobs to the `Config.PoliceJobs` value
- Add all of your EMS jobs to the `Config.EMSJobs` value
- Setting `Config.DispatchDecayTime` will change how long an event takes to 'delete'
- Setting `Config.BlipScale` will change how large/small your blips are.
- We recommend looking through all of the `Config.Events` that are shipped by default and customising them to your server - blip sprites can be found [here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/#blips) and blip colours can be found [here](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/blips/#blip-colors)
